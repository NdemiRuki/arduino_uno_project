# arduino_uno_project
Combines an Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo Motor using an Arduino Uno microcomputer. 

The project merges an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor using Arduino Uno. 
The sensor detects object distance, enabling the Arduino to modify the servo motor's speed accordingly.
As objects come closer, the motor accelerates, and it decelerates as objects move away. 
This project is an ideal entry point for learning about sensor integration and adaptive control. 
It offers hands-on experience and insight into practical applications of real-time environment-based motor adjustments.

# Dependencies
To run the code you can use VS Code or Arduino IDE. I would recommend using Arduino IDE as it will show the user the distance 
calculated by the ultrasonic sensor clearly. 

# Installing
How to install Arduino IDE? https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
 
 -> I would suggest installing the Arduino IDE 2.1.1 as it is the one I used when creating this code.
